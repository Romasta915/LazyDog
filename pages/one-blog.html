                    farm and raising pigs. Can you tell us a little bit about the journey from Great-Great-Grandpa Fred
                    finding the farm to today?</span>

                    Many of you may be familiar with our housemade Creamy Dijon Chicken or weekend brunch Country
                    Quiche. They say the best food starts with the best ingredients – and the proof is in the pudding
                    with these two dishes!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The star ingredients of both popular recipes is none other than Beeler’s applewood smoked ham. What
                    makes it so special? It’s uncured (no processing or additives used), antibiotic-free, humanely
                    raised pork. And the best part? It comes from a family-owned business that shares the same care for
                    their craft and commitment to quality that we do here at Lazy Dog.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Meet our partner, Beeler’s Pure Pork. Their family farm in Madison County, Iowa, was founded in 1846
                    by Great-Great-Grandpa Fred Beeler. Since then, the farm has been passed down through six
                    generations. In fact, the Beeler family still owns it today. Even after more than 175 years, their
                    mission has remained the same: to source the very best, most wholesome pork products. Wh en you
                    combine that mission with the power of family, the result is flavorful food sourced with love.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We couldn’t be happier to serve their product at our table – and share their story with you. We sat
                    down with Fred’s great-great-grandson, Tim Beeler, who runs today’s operation. The Beeler's dream
                    originated from a story and grit…

                    You can, of course, buy the license for Windows. And I even bought it twice, together with a laptop
                    and a tablet PC. But you will have to buy it again after each major upgrade. And when you sell your
                    old computer, hardly anyone will want to pay extra for the licensed Windows. Also, if the computer
                    is broken or lost then the license is lost too. Therefore you should compare the time of learning
                    Linux not with the price of one license, but with all of them you will have to buy during your
                    lifetime. And the knowledge of Linux, you invest into it once and it is with you till kingdom come,
                    or possibly even further.
